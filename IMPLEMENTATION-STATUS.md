## 📦 Modular Architecture

### Modules Created
1. **game-state.mjs** - Central state management
2. **card-mechanics.mjs** - Card type detection, DFC database
3. **ui-updates.mjs** - All DOM manipulation, rendering
4. **combat.mjs** - Combat system
5. **core-methods.mjs** - Core gameplay (draw, mulligan, turns)
6. **library-modals.mjs** - Ponder, Brainstorm, Scry, Surveil interfaces

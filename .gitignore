# Keep reference/seed decks committed for the app to function
# All XML files are tracked - users can modify locally without commits
# To ignore future user deck additions, uncomment below:
# xml/user-decks/
# decks/user-uploads/

# Environment files (actual secrets only - keep .env.example in git)
.env

```markdown
The code for your `controller.js` module, which sets up routes and handlers for your Express application. This code defines routes for various actions, including handling XML file uploads and deck creation. 

1. **Importing Modules**: You import necessary functions and objects from your `config.mjs` and other modules.

2. **Route Definition**: You define an array of route objects, each specifying a path and the corresponding template to render.

3. **Route Handling**: Using a loop, you set up the defined routes and their handlers. These routes include rendering templates and handling POST requests for XML file uploads and deck creation.

4. **Handling POST Requests**: For the `/clicked` route, you handle POST requests. You log the XML file and click information to the console, then use the `loadXMLDoc` function to process the XML file. After that, you send a success status code (201) to the client, or handle errors as needed.

5. **Deck Creation Form**: You have a route, `/create-deck-form`, which renders a template for a deck creation form.

6. **Deck Creation Handling**: For the `/create-deck` route, you handle POST requests for deck creation. This is where you can process the form data, create an XML structure, save it to a file, and add appropriate validation and error handling. You also send a success status code (201) to the client in case of a successful deck creation or handle errors.

Overall, handles the various routes and actions in your Node.js application effectively.
